# Sense-Hub

## General Description
Sense-Hub is a modular platform based on ESP32 for smart monitoring and control of environments. It allows the integration of multiple sensors and devices, facilitating supervision, automation, and efficient management in a wide range of applications. Its scalable and flexible design makes it ideal for Internet of Things (IoT) projects.
