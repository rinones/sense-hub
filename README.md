# DIY Environmental and Security Monitoring System with Mainframe Integration

Welcome to my first professional IT project!  
This repository showcases a DIY environmental and security monitoring system designed to demonstrate my learning and skills in mainframe environments (COBOL, CICS, DB2). The goal is to replicate the robustness, reliability, and standards of mission-critical systems used in banking, stock exchanges, and large financial institutions by integrating a network of ESP32 microcontrollers and sensors with a secure, transaction-oriented mainframe backend.
